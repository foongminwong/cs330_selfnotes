Section 6.5.1 enumeration-controlled loops

- Iteration and recursion: mechanisms, allow a computer to perform
similar operations repeatedly

- imperative vs functional language (see picture)

Programmers in imperative languages tend to use iteration(loops) more than they use
recursion (recursion is more common in functional languages).

- enumeration-controlled loop VS logically controlled loop

An enumeration-controlled loop is executed
once for every value in a given finite set; the number of iterations is known before
the first iteration begins. A logically controlled loop is executed until some Boolean
condition (which must generally depend on values altered in the loop) changes
value.

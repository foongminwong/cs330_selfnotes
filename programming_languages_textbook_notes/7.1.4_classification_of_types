Sec 7.1.4 Classification of Types
- boolean (logicals: implemented as single-byte
quantities, with 1 representing true and 0 representing false)

- C expects an integer; zero means false, and anything else means true.

- C is unusual in its lack of a Boolean type

- characters traditionally/typically one byte using ASCII encoding

- recent languages like Java and C# use a two-byte representation to accommodate the Unicode character set.

Under Enumeration Types

- enumeration is a full-fledged type, incompatible with integers.

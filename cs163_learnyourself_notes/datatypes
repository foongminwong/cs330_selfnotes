-	Variable: stores info and has identifier
-	Initialization: put value into a variable (not required)
-	Variable definition
-	Number literal: number written by a programmer
-	Double: num with fractional part/in exponential notation
-	Variable name: NO $ and %, spaces NOT PERMITTED, lowercase recommended, case-sensitive
-	Change variable : 1. Assignment 2. Increment/decrement by operator 3. Input into them
-	1. Assignment: store a new value in a variable to replace the previously stored value
-	Initialization VS assignment
-	= : copy the value of the expression on the right into the variable on the left
-	const: define a constant, cannot be changed and must be set when created, in CAPITAL, anti magic numbers
-	comments: explanantions for human readers of your code/other programmers, compiler ignores comments completely
-	if you don't initialize a variable, some value will be there, the flotsam left over fromsome previous calculation or simply random value tehre when the transistors in RAM were first turned on.
-	BETTER to initialize
-	float vs double: float use half storage of teh double type, it can only store 6-7 digits
-	long double: quadruple precision
-	 compiler manufacturer types: long long
-	C++ standard does nto completely specify the num of bytes or ranges for numeric types.
- 	the result is larger than an int can hold 
-	roundoff errors
= 	#include<cmath>: sqrt, pow, sin,cos, tan, log10(x), abs(x)
-	operators with same precedence are evaluated from left to right
-	7/3 is not 7.0/3
-	<iostream>, carries out input or output, <cstdlib>
-	cplusplus.com
-	add 0.5 to round to the nearest integer
-	use spaces around arithmetic operators, but not in function names
-	cast: 1. need to store a value into variable of a different type 2. risk of info loss, compiler generally issues a warning 3.conversion of one type to another type, not safe
-	statis_cats<  the type you want   >() - express a cast in C++
-	cin >> input
-	manipulator for formatted output, #include<iomanip>
-	using namespace std;
-	setprecision(2)
-	setw - set width of the next output field, affects the next value
-	#include<string>
-	literal strings cannot be concatenated
-	string functions: substr(start, length), length,
